# Prompt 1
Write a Python code that can perform the following tasks.
Read the CSV file, located on a given file path, into a Pandas data frame, assuming that the first rows of the file are the headers for the data.

# Response

Sure! Here is a Python code snippet that reads a CSV file into a Pandas data frame:

```python
import pandas as pd

file_path = "path/to/your/file.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
print(df)
```

In this code, replace `"path/to/your/file.csv"` with the actual file path where your CSV file is located. The `pd.read_csv()` function reads the CSV file into a Pandas data frame. By default, it assumes that the first row of the file contains the column headers. You can then use the `df` variable to access and manipulate the data in the data frame.


### Prompt 2
Write a Python code that identifies the columns with missing values in a pandas data frame


## Response

Certainly! Here is a Python code snippet that identifies the columns with missing values in a Pandas data frame:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'df' is your Pandas data frame
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
columns_with_missing_values = missing_values[missing_values > 0].index.tolist()

print("Columns with missing values:")
print(columns_with_missing_values)
```

In this code, the `df.isnull().sum()` function calculates the number of missing values in each column of the data frame. The code then filters out columns with missing values greater than 0 and stores their column names in the `columns_with_missing_values` list. Finally, it prints out the columns with missing values.



### Prompt 3
Write a Python code to replace the missing values in a pandas data frame, per the following guidelines.
1. For a categorical attribute "Screen_Size_cm", replace the missing values with the most frequent value in the column.
2. For a continuous value attribute "Weight_kg", replace the missing values with the mean value of the entries in the column.


### Response

Certainly! Here is a Python code snippet that identifies the columns with missing values in a Pandas data frame:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'df' is your Pandas data frame
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
columns_with_missing_values = missing_values[missing_values > 0].index.tolist()

print("Columns with missing values:")
print(columns_with_missing_values)
```

In this code, the `df.isnull().sum()` function calculates the number of missing values in each column of the data frame. The code then filters out columns with missing values greater than 0 and stores their column names in the `columns_with_missing_values` list. Finally, it prints out the columns with missing values.

Write a Python code to replace the missing values in a pandas data frame, per the following guidelines.
1. For a categorical attribute "Screen_Size_cm", replace the missing values with the most frequent value in the column.
2. For a continuous value attribute "Weight_kg", replace the missing values with the mean value of the entries in the column.

Of course! Here is a Python code snippet that replaces missing values in a Pandas data frame according to the guidelines you provided:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'df' is your Pandas data frame

# Replace missing values in 'Screen_Size_cm' with the most frequent value
most_frequent_screen_size = df['Screen_Size_cm'].mode()[0]
df['Screen_Size_cm'].fillna(most_frequent_screen_size, inplace=True)

# Replace missing values in 'Weight_kg' with the mean value
mean_weight = df['Weight_kg'].mean()
df['Weight_kg'].fillna(mean_weight, inplace=True)

# Verify that missing values have been replaced
print(df)
```

In this code, we first calculate the most frequent value for the 'Screen_Size_cm' column using the `mode()` function and the mean value for the 'Weight_kg' column using the `mean()` function. We then use the `fillna()` function to replace the missing values in each column with the calculated values. Finally, we print out the updated data frame to verify that the missing values have been replaced according to the guidelines.




## Prompt 4
Write a Python code snippet to change the data type of the attributes "Screen_Size_cm" and "Weight_kg" of a data frame to float.

## Response
Certainly! Here is a Python code snippet that changes the data type of the attributes "Screen_Size_cm" and "Weight_kg" of a data frame to float:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'df' is your Pandas data frame

# Change data type of 'Screen_Size_cm' to float
df['Screen_Size_cm'] = df['Screen_Size_cm'].astype(float)

# Change data type of 'Weight_kg' to float
df['Weight_kg'] = df['Weight_kg'].astype(float)

# Verify that the data types have been changed
print(df.dtypes)
```

In this code, we use the `astype()` function to convert the data type of the 'Screen_Size_cm' and 'Weight_kg' columns to float. Finally, we print out the data types of all columns in the data frame to verify that the conversion was successful.


## Prompt 5
Write a Python code to modify the contents under the following attributes of the data frame as required.
1. Data under 'Screen_Size_cm' is assumed to be in centimeters. Convert this data into inches. Modify the name of the attribute to 'Screen_Size_inch'.
2. Data under 'Weight_kg' is assumed to be in kilograms. Convert this data into pounds. Modify the name of the attribute to 'Weight_pounds'.

## Response
Certainly! Here is a Python code snippet that modifies the contents under the specified attributes of the data frame as required:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'df' is your Pandas data frame

# Convert 'Screen_Size_cm' from centimeters to inches
df['Screen_Size_inch'] = df['Screen_Size_cm'] * 0.393701  # 1 cm = 0.393701 inches

# Convert 'Weight_kg' from kilograms to pounds
df['Weight_pounds'] = df['Weight_kg'] * 2.20462  # 1 kg = 2.20462 pounds

# Drop the original columns 'Screen_Size_cm' and 'Weight_kg'
df.drop(['Screen_Size_cm', 'Weight_kg'], axis=1, inplace=True)

# Verify the modifications
print(df)
```

In this code, we create new columns 'Screen_Size_inch' and 'Weight_pounds' by converting the data from centimeters to inches and from kilograms to pounds, respectively. We then drop the original columns 'Screen_Size_cm' and 'Weight_kg'. Finally, we print out the modified data frame to verify the changes.


## Prompt 6
Write a Python code to normalize the content under the attribute "CPU_frequency" in a data frame df concerning its maximum value. Make changes to the original data, and do not create a new attribute.

## Response
Certainly! Here is a Python code snippet that normalizes the content under the attribute "CPU_frequency" in a data frame `df` with respect to its maximum value without creating a new attribute:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'df' is your Pandas data frame

# Normalize 'CPU_frequency' with respect to its maximum value
max_cpu_frequency = df['CPU_frequency'].max()
df['CPU_frequency'] = df['CPU_frequency'] / max_cpu_frequency

# Verify the normalization
print(df)
```

In this code, we normalize the values in the 'CPU_frequency' column by dividing each value by the maximum value in that column. This normalization process scales the values between 0 and 1 based on the maximum value in the column. Finally, we print out the data frame to confirm the normalization of the 'CPU_frequency' attribute.


## Prompt 7
Write a Python code to perform the following tasks.
1. Convert a data frame df attribute "Screen", into indicator variables, saved as df1, with the naming convention "Screen_<unique value of the attribute>".
2. Append df1 into the original data frame df.
3. Drop the original attribute from the data frame df.

## Response
Certainly! Here is a Python code snippet that performs the tasks you specified:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'df' is your Pandas data frame

# Convert 'Screen' attribute into indicator variables
df1 = pd.get_dummies(df['Screen'], prefix='Screen')

# Append df1 into the original data frame df
df = pd.concat([df, df1], axis=1)

# Drop the original 'Screen' attribute from the data frame df
df.drop('Screen', axis=1, inplace=True)

# Verify the changes
print(df)
```

In this code, we first use the `get_dummies()` function to convert the 'Screen' attribute into indicator variables with the specified naming convention. We then concatenate the new data frame `df1` with the original data frame `df` along the columns axis. After that, we drop the original 'Screen' attribute from the data frame `df`. Finally, we print out the modified data frame to confirm the changes.
