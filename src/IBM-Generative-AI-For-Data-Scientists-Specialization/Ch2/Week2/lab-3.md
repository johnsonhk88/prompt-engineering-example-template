| Bob is in the living room. He walks to the kitchen, carrying a cup. He puts a ball in the cup and carries the cup to the bedroom. He turns the cup upside down, then walks to the garden. He puts the cup down in the garden, then walks to the garage. Where is the ball? | Based on the sequence of events described, it is clear that Bob placed the ball in the cup in the kitchen and then carried the cup to the bedroom. He then turned the cup upside down in the bedroom before proceeding to the garden and then the garage. Since the ball was never removed from the cup after being placed in it, the ball should still be in the cup in the bedroom. | Building upon Expert 2's analysis, it is indeed logical to conclude that the ball is still in the cup in the bedroom. Bob never took the ball out of the cup after placing it there, so it would make sense for the ball to remain in the cup in the bedroom. Therefore, the ball is in the cup in the bedroom. | Expert 2's reasoning is sound. By following the sequence of events described, it is evident that the ball is still in the cup in the bedroom. Bob did not remove the ball from the cup at any point in the scenario, so it must be in the cup in the bedroom. Hence, the ball is in the cup in the bedroom. |
