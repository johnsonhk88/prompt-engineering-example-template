How does Artificial Intelligence work?

# Response
Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is like a super smart computer that can learn and think on its own. It works by using a lot of data and algorithms to make decisions and solve problems. Algorithms are like step-by-step instructions that tell the computer what to do. AI can learn from the data it gets and use it to make predictions or help solve problems. It's kind of like how you learn from your experiences and use that knowledge to make decisions.
